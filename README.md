# LUKSO CLI

The LUKSO CLI is a command line tool to install, manage and set up validators of different clients for the LUKSO Blockchain. For more information and tutorial, please check the [LUKSO Tech Docs](https://docs.lukso.tech/).

## Features

- ðŸ§° Installation of Execution, Consensus, and Validator Clients
- ðŸ“€ Running a node as a validator
- ðŸ“‘ Accessing various client logs

## Supported EVM Clients

The LUKSO CLI is able to install multiple clients for running the node.

- Execution Clients: [Geth](https://geth.ethereum.org/), [Erigon](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon)
- Consensus Clients: [Prysm](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm), [Lighthouse](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse)
- Validator Staking Clients: [Prysm](https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/how-prysm-works/prysm-validator-client), [Lighthouse](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse)

> More clients will be added in the future.

## Supported Platforms

The LUKSO CLI is officially supported on Mac, Ubuntu, and Debian with the following architectures:

- `x86`/`x86_64`: Intel and AMD Processors
- `ARM`/`aarch64`: Single-Board Computers as M1 or Raspberry

> The experience might differ with other setups or versions of these operating systems.

## Setting up the Node

Process of setting up the node using the LUSKO CLI.

### Installing the LUKSO CLI

- Download and execute the LUKSO CLI installation script
- Running this script will install the full LUKSO CLI on Mac and Linux
- Installation directory: `/usr/local/bin/lukso`

```sh
# Might need admin access by typing `sudo` in front of the command
$ curl https://install.lukso.network | sh
```

### Initialise the Working Directory

1. Create and move into a working directory for your node's data

```sh
# Exchange [folder_name] with the folder name you want
$ mkdir [folder_name] && cd ./[folder_name]
```

2. Initialize the working directory

```sh
# Downloads all network configs from https://github.com/lukso-network/network-configs
$ lukso init
```

### Installing the Clients

3. Install choosen LUKSO clients into the working directory

```sh
# Installing Execution, Consensus, and Validator Client
# Might need admin access by typing `sudo` in front of the command
$ lukso install
```

### Starting the Clients

Please refer to the `start` command below for more information.

## Working Directories's Structure

As the LUKSO CLI is able to manage multiple clients for multiple blockchain networks in one folder, the structure of the node is set up in a generic way.

- When initializing the node (with `lukso init`), a global configuration folder is created, which holds shared and unique client information for each type of network.
- When executing commands, directories for the associated network type will be created accordingly.

Network Types: `mainnet`, `testnet`, `devnet`

> Even if multiple networks are set up, only one can be active simultaneously, as the LUKSO CLI runs natively within your system environments.

### `install`

#### How to install the clients

```sh
# User is able to select its Consensus and Execution clients.
# Detects pre-installed clients and will ask for overrides
$ lukso install

# Installs clients and agrees with Terms & Conditions automatically
$ lukso install --agree-terms
```

#### Options for `install`

| Option        | Description                               |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| --agree-terms | Automatically accept Terms and Conditions |

### `start`

#### How to start the clients

```sh
# Starts your node and connects to LUKSO mainnet
# Uses the default config files from configs/mainnet folder
$ lukso start

# Starts your node and connects to mainnet as a validator
$ lukso start --validator --transaction-fee-recipient "0x1234..."

# Starts your node and connects to the LUKSO testnet
$ lukso start --testnet

# Starts your node and connects to testnet as a validator
$ lukso start --testnet --validator --transaction-fee-recipient "0x1234..."
```

#### How to start a node using config files

```sh
# Geth Configutation
# Change [config] to the name of your configuration file
$ lukso start --geth-config "./[config].toml"

# Prysm Configutation
# Change [config] to the name of your configuration file
# Change [custom_bootnode] to the bootnode's name
$ lukso start --prysm-config "./[config].yaml" --geth-bootnodes "[custom_bootnode]"

# Lighthouse Configutation
# Change [config] to the name of your configuration file
# Change [custom_bootnode] to the bootnode's name
$ lukso start --lighthouse-config "./[config].yaml" --lighthouse-bootnodes "[custom_bootnode]"

# An experienced user can also start custom clients
# Example with Lighthouse and Erigon clients
$ lukso start --lighthouse --erigon
```

#### How to set up and customize a logs folder

```sh
# Setting up a custom logs directory
# Change [folder path] to a static or dynamic directory path
$ lukso start --logs-folder "[folder_path]"
```

#### Using Checkpoint Syncing

Checkpoint synchronization is a feature that significantly speeds up the initial sync time of the consensus client. If enabled, your node will begin syncing from a recently finalized consensus checkpoint instead of genesis. The shortcut makes installation, validator migration, or recovery much faster.

```sh
# Mainnet Checkpoint Sync for Consensus Client
$ lukso start --checkpoint-sync

# Testnet Checkpoint Sync for Consensus Client
$ lukso start --testnet --checkpoint-sync
```

# Displays the help page of the start command
$ lukso start -h
```

## Running a Validator

Validator keys can be generated using:

- CLI: [tools-key-gen-cli](https://github.com/lukso-network/tools-key-gen-cli)
- GUI: [wagyu-key-gen](https://github.com/lukso-network/tools-wagyu-key-gen)

> Both of them will generate the validator keys directory.

After generating the validator keys, they can be imported into the LUKSO CLI. To fill the validator keys with funds to participate on the LUKSO Blockchain, you must use the [LUKSO Launchpad](https://deposit.mainnet.lukso.network) to send LYXe from your wallet to the generated keys.

#### Genesis Amounts

- All genesis validators will be prompted to vote for the initial token supply of LYX
- The initial token supply will determine how much LYX the Foundation will receive
- More details at: https://deposit.mainnet.lukso.network

#### Validator Stake

- Genesis Validators need to have at least 32 LYXe per validator
- Validators also need some ETH on their wallet to pay for gas expenses

### `validator import`

Import existing EIP-2335 keystore files (such as those generated by the [Wagyu Keygen](https://github.com/lukso-network/tools-wagyu-key-gen)) into Prysm.

For `validator import` command the `--validator-keys` flag is required.

```sh
# Regular import process
# You will be asked for the passwords - of your validator keys and newly generated wallet

lukso validator import --validator-keys "./myKeysDir"

# You will be asked only for wallet password
lukso validator import --validator-keys "./myKeysDir" --validator-password "./myKeysPasswordFile.txt"
```

#### Options for `validator import`

| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| --validator-keys [string]     | Directory of the validator keys (default: "./\[network_type\]-keystore")    |
| --validator-password [string] | Path to validator keys' password file                                       |
| **NETWORK**                   |                                                                             |
| --mainnet                     | Will import the keys for mainnet [default] (Will use: "./mainnet-keystore") |
| --testnet                     | Will import the keys for testnet (Will use: "./testnet-keystore")           |
| --devnet                      | Will import the keys for devnet (Will use: "./devnet-keystore")             |

### `validator list`

List all imported keys from the validators keystore.

### `validator exit`

Issue an exit for your validator keys that have set withdrawal credentials.

> ETH1 withdrawal addresses are required for the exit to work. These are automatically generated by the [Wagyu Key-Gen Tool](https://github.com/lukso-network/tools-wagyu-key-gen). If you used BLS keys from the [Key Gen CLI](https://github.com/lukso-network/tools-key-gen-cli) without specifying a withdrawal address, please update your withdrawal address credentials first.

**IMPORTANT:** The Validator exit is an **irreversible** action. Before exiting your validator you need make sure you are mindful of what the exit process carries with itself. #

Because different clients have different processes of exiting please make sure that **you are familiar with the flags** provided by the `validator exit` command.

#### How to exit validator keys

Make sure your validator node is running before starting the exit command.

```sh
# Exit validator keys with Prysm for Mainnet
sudo lukso validator exit

# Exit validator keys with Prysm for Testnet
sudo lukso validator exit --testnet

# Exit a validator key with Lighthouse for Mainnet
sudo lukso validator exit --keystore "./mainnet-keystore/keystore-xxx.json"

# Exit a validator key with Lighthouse for Testnet
sudo lukso validator exit --testnet --keystore "./testnet-keystore/keystore-xxx.json"
```

> The Lighthouse client only allows to exit one validator key at a time. In case you have plenty of keys, please generate a separate keyfolder in a different working directory using Prysm. The new keystore folder can then be used for the exit command, even if your node is running the Lighthouse consensus client.

| Option                          | Description                                                                                                                        |

| --validator-wallet-dir [string] | Path to wallet containing validators that you want to exit (default: "./mainnet-keystore" - is affected by the network flag)       |
| --rpc-address [string]          | Address of node that is used to make an exit (defaults to the default RPC address provided by your selected client)                |

For specific validator options, please visit the [Prysm Validator Specification](https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/wallet/nondeterministic). All flags and their parameters will be passed to the client. This can be useful to configure additional features like the validator's graffiti, extended logging, or connectivity options.

### Starting the Validator

#### How to start your validator (keys & tx fee recipient)

When you use `--validator`, the `--transaction-fee-recipient` flag is required.

```sh
# Specify the transaction fee recipient, also known as coinbase
# It is the address where the transactions fees are sent to
$ lukso start --validator --transaction-fee-recipient "0x12345678..."
```

If you want to provide a specific keystore directory, you can use the `--validator-keys` flag. If no `--validator-keys` flag was specified, the CLI will look in the default directory: `./[network_type]-keystore`.:

```sh
# Validator keys
# Command split across multiple lines for readability
# Change [file_name] with the your password text file's name
$ lukso start --validator \
--transaction-fee-recipient "0x12345678..." \
--validator-keys "./custom-keystore-dir-path"
```

#### How to start a genesis node

```sh
# Command split across multiple lines for readability
# Make sure that both SSZ and JSON files are placed correctly
$ lukso start \
--genesis-ssz "./config/mainnet/shared/genesis.ssz" \
--genesis-json "./config/mainnet/shared/genesis.json"
```

## Uninstalling
